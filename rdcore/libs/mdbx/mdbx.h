 **** INTRODUCTION *************************************************************
 *
 *   // For the most part, this section is a copy of the corresponding text
 *   // from LMDB description, but with some edits reflecting the improvements
 *   // and enhancements were made in MDBX.
 *
 * MDBX is a Btree-based database management library modeled loosely on the
 * BerkeleyDB API, but much simplified. The entire database (aka "environment")
 * is exposed in a memory map, and all data fetches return data directly from
 * the mapped memory, so no malloc's or memcpy's occur during data fetches.
 * As such, the library is extremely simple because it requires no page caching
 * layer of its own, and it is extremely high performance and memory-efficient.
 * It is also fully transactional with full ACID semantics, and when the memory
 * map is read-only, the database integrity cannot be corrupted by stray pointer
 * writes from application code.
 *
 * The library is fully thread-aware and supports concurrent read/write access
 * from multiple processes and threads. Data pages use a copy-on-write strategy
 * so no active data pages are ever overwritten, which also provides resistance
 * to corruption and eliminates the need of any special recovery procedures
 * after a system crash. Writes are fully serialized; only one write transaction
 * may be active at a time, which guarantees that writers can never deadlock.
 * The database structure is multi-versioned so readers run with no locks;
 * writers cannot block readers, and readers don't block writers.
 *
 * Unlike other well-known database mechanisms which use either write-ahead
 * transaction logs or append-only data writes, MDBX requires no maintenance
 * during operation. Both write-ahead loggers and append-only databases require
 * periodic checkpointing and/or compaction of their log or database files
 * otherwise they grow without bound. MDBX tracks retired/freed pages within the
 * database and re-uses them for new write operations, so the database size does
 * not grow without bound in normal use. It is worth noting that the "next"
 * version libmdbx (MithrilDB) will solve this problem.
 *
 * The memory map can be used as a read-only or read-write map. It is read-only
 * by default as this provides total immunity to corruption. Using read-write
 * mode offers much higher write performance, but adds the possibility for stray
 * application writes thru pointers to silently corrupt the database.
 * Of course if your application code is known to be bug-free (...) then this is
 * not an issue.
 *
 * If this is your first time using a transactional embedded key-value store,
 * you may find the "GETTING STARTED" section below to be helpful.
 *
 *
 **** GETTING STARTED **********************************************************
 *
 *   // This section is based on Bert Hubert's intro "LMDB Semantics", with
 *   // edits reflecting the improvements and enhancements were made in MDBX.
 *   // See https://bit.ly/2maejGY for Bert Hubert's original.
 *
 * Everything starts with an environment, created by mdbx_env_create().
 * Once created, this environment must also be opened with mdbx_env_open(),
 * and after use be closed by mdbx_env_close(). At that a non-zero value of the
 * last argument "mode" supposes MDBX will create database and directory if ones
 * does not exist. In this case the non-zero "mode" argument specifies the file
 * mode bits be applied when a new files are created by open() function.
 *
 * Within that directory, a lock file (aka LCK-file) and a storage file (aka
 * DXB-file) will be generated. If you don't want to use a directory, you can
 * pass the MDBX_NOSUBDIR option, in which case the path you provided is used
 * directly as the DXB-file, and another file with a "-lck" suffix added
 * will be used for the LCK-file.
 *
 * Once the environment is open, a transaction can be created within it using
 * mdbx_txn_begin(). Transactions may be read-write or read-only, and read-write
 * transactions may be nested. A transaction must only be used by one thread at
 * a time. Transactions are always required, even for read-only access. The
 * transaction provides a consistent view of the data.
 *
 * Once a transaction has been created, a database (i.e. key-value space inside
 * the environment) can be opened within it using mdbx_dbi_open(). If only one
 * database will ever be used in the environment, a NULL can be passed as the
 * database name. For named databases, the MDBX_CREATE flag must be used to
 * create the database if it doesn't already exist. Also, mdbx_env_set_maxdbs()
 * must be called after mdbx_env_create() and before mdbx_env_open() to set the
 * maximum number of named databases you want to support.
 *
 * NOTE: a single transaction can open multiple databases. Generally databases
 *       should only be opened once, by the first transaction in the process.
 *
 * Within a transaction, mdbx_get() and mdbx_put() can store single key-value
 * pairs if that is all you need to do (but see CURSORS below if you want to do
 * more).
 *
 * A key-value pair is expressed as two MDBX_val structures. This struct that is
 * exactly similar to POSIX's struct iovec and has two fields, iov_len and
 * iov_base. The data is a void pointer to an array of iov_len bytes.
 * (!) The notable difference between MDBX and LMDB is that MDBX support zero
 * length keys.
 *
 * Because MDBX is very efficient (and usually zero-copy), the data returned in
 * an MDBX_val structure may be memory-mapped straight from disk. In other words
 * look but do not touch (or free() for that matter). Once a transaction is
 * closed, the values can no longer be used, so make a copy if you need to keep
 * them after that.
 *
 *
 * CURSORS -- To do more powerful things, we must use a cursor.
 *
 * Within the transaction, a cursor can be created with mdbx_cursor_open().
 * With this cursor we can store/retrieve/delete (multiple) values using
 * mdbx_cursor_get(), mdbx_cursor_put(), and mdbx_cursor_del().
 *
 * mdbx_cursor_get() positions itself depending on the cursor operation
 * requested, and for some operations, on the supplied key. For example, to list
 * all key-value pairs in a database, use operation MDBX_FIRST for the first
 * call to mdbx_cursor_get(), and MDBX_NEXT on subsequent calls, until the end
 * is hit.
 *
 * To retrieve all keys starting from a specified key value, use MDBX_SET. For
 * more cursor operations, see the API description below.
 *
 * When using mdbx_cursor_put(), either the function will position the cursor
 * for you based on the key, or you can use operation MDBX_CURRENT to use the
 * current position of the cursor. NOTE that key must then match the current
 * position's key.
 *
 *
 * SUMMARIZING THE OPENING
 *
 * So we have a cursor in a transaction which opened a database in an
 * environment which is opened from a filesystem after it was separately
 * created.
 *
 * Or, we create an environment, open it from a filesystem, create a transaction
 * within it, open a database within that transaction, and create a cursor
 * within all of the above.
 *
 * Got it?
 *
 *
 * THREADS AND PROCESSES
 *
 * Do not have open an database twice in the same process at the same time, MDBX
 * will track and prevent this. Instead, share the MDBX environment that has
 * opened the file across all threads. The reason for this is:
 *  - When the "Open file description" locks (aka OFD-locks) are not available,
 *    MDBX uses POSIX locks on files, and these locks have issues if one process
 *    opens a file multiple times.
 *  - If a single process opens the same environment multiple times, closing it
 *    once will remove all the locks held on it, and the other instances will be
 *    vulnerable to corruption from other processes.
 *  + For compatibility with LMDB which allows multi-opening, MDBX can be
 *    configured at runtime by mdbx_setup_debug(MDBX_DBG_LEGACY_MULTIOPEN, ...)
 *    prior to calling other MDBX funcitons. In this way MDBX will track
 *    databases opening, detect multi-opening cases and then recover POSIX file
 *    locks as necessary. However, lock recovery can cause unexpected pauses,
 *    such as when another process opened the database in exclusive mode before
 *    the lock was restored - we have to wait until such a process releases the
 *    database, and so on.
 *
 * Do not use opened MDBX environment(s) after fork() in a child process(es),
 * MDBX will check and prevent this at critical points. Instead, ensure there is
 * no open MDBX-instance(s) during fork(), or atleast close it immediately after
 * fork() in the child process and reopen if required - for instance by using
 * pthread_atfork(). The reason for this is:
 *  - For competitive consistent reading, MDBX assigns a slot in the shared
 *    table for each process that interacts with the database. This slot is
 *    populated with process attributes, including the PID.
 *  - After fork(), in order to remain connected to a database, the child
 *    process must have its own such "slot", which can't be assigned in any
 *    simple and robust way another than the regular.
 *  - A write transaction from a parent process cannot continue in a child
 *    process for obvious reasons.
 *  - Moreover, in a multithreaded process at the fork() moment any number of
 *    threads could run in critical and/or intermediate sections of MDBX code
 *    with interaction and/or racing conditions with threads from other
 *    process(es). For instance: shrinking a database or copying it to a pipe,
 *    opening or closing environment, begining or finishing a transaction,
 *    and so on.
 *  = Therefore, any solution other than simply close database (and reopen if
 *    necessary) in a child process would be both extreme complicated and so
 *    fragile.
 *
 * Do not start more than one transaction for a one thread. If you think about
 * this, it's really strange to do something with two data snapshots at once,
 * which may be different. MDBX checks and preventing this by returning
 * corresponding error code (MDBX_TXN_OVERLAPPING, MDBX_BAD_RSLOT, MDBX_BUSY)
 * unless you using MDBX_NOTLS option on the environment. Nonetheless, with the
 * MDBX_NOTLS option, you must know exactly what you are doing, otherwise you
 * will get deadlocks or reading an alien data.
 *
 * Also note that a transaction is tied to one thread by default using Thread
 * Local Storage. If you want to pass read-only transactions across threads,
 * you can use the MDBX_NOTLS option on the environment. Nevertheless, a write
 * transaction entirely should only be used in one thread from start to finish.
 * MDBX checks this in a reasonable manner and return the MDBX_THREAD_MISMATCH
 * error in rules violation.
 *
 *
 * TRANSACTIONS, ROLLBACKS, etc.
 *
 * To actually get anything done, a transaction must be committed using
 * mdbx_txn_commit(). Alternatively, all of a transaction's operations
 * can be discarded using mdbx_txn_abort().
 *
 * (!) An important difference between MDBX and LMDB is that MDBX required that
 * any opened cursors can be reused and must be freed explicitly, regardless
 * ones was opened in a read-only or write transaction. The REASON for this is
 * eliminates ambiguity which helps to avoid errors such as: use-after-free,
 * double-free, i.e. memory corruption and segfaults.
 *
 * For read-only transactions, obviously there is nothing to commit to storage.
 * (!) An another notable difference between MDBX and LMDB is that MDBX make
 * handles opened for existing databases immediately available for other
 * transactions, regardless this transaction will be aborted or reset. The
 * REASON for this is to avoiding the requirement for multiple opening a same
 * handles in concurrent read transactions, and tracking of such open but hidden
 * handles until the completion of read transactions which opened them.
 *
 * In addition, as long as a transaction is open, a consistent view of the
 * database is kept alive, which requires storage. A read-only transaction that
 * no longer requires this consistent view should be terminated (committed or
 * aborted) when the view is no longer needed (but see below for an
 * optimization).
 *
 * There can be multiple simultaneously active read-only transactions but only
 * one that can write. Once a single read-write transaction is opened, all
 * further attempts to begin one will block until the first one is committed or
 * aborted. This has no effect on read-only transactions, however, and they may
 * continue to be opened at any time.
 *
 *
 * DUPLICATE KEYS
 *
 * mdbx_get() and mdbx_put() respectively have no and only some support or
 * multiple key-value pairs with identical keys. If there are multiple values
 * for a key, mdbx_get() will only return the first value.
 *
 * When multiple values for one key are required, pass the MDBX_DUPSORT flag to
 * mdbx_dbi_open(). In an MDBX_DUPSORT database, by default mdbx_put() will not
 * replace the value for a key if the key existed already. Instead it will add
 * the new value to the key. In addition, mdbx_del() will pay attention to the
 * value field too, allowing for specific values of a key to be deleted.
 *
 * Finally, additional cursor operations become available for traversing through
 * and retrieving duplicate values.
 *
 *
 * SOME OPTIMIZATION
 *
 * If you frequently begin and abort read-only transactions, as an optimization,
 * it is possible to only reset and renew a transaction.
 *
 * mdbx_txn_reset() releases any old copies of data kept around for a read-only
 * transaction. To reuse this reset transaction, call mdbx_txn_renew() on it.
 * Any cursors in this transaction can also be renewed using mdbx_cursor_renew()
 * or freed by mdbx_cursor_close().
 *
 * To permanently free a transaction, reset or not, use mdbx_txn_abort().
 *
 *
 * CLEANING UP
 *
 * Any created cursors must be closed using mdbx_cursor_close(). It is advisable
 * to repeat:
 * (!) An important difference between MDBX and LMDB is that MDBX required that
 * any opened cursors can be reused and must be freed explicitly, regardless
 * ones was opened in a read-only or write transaction. The REASON for this is
 * eliminates ambiguity which helps to avoid errors such as: use-after-free,
 * double-free, i.e. memory corruption and segfaults.
 *
 * It is very rarely necessary to close a database handle, and in general they
 * should just be left open. When you close a handle, it immediately becomes
 * unavailable for all transactions in the environment. Therefore, you should
 * avoid closing the handle while at least one transaction is using it.
 *
 *
 * THE FULL API
 *
 *   The full MDBX documentation lists further details below,
 *   like how to:
 *
 *     - configure database size and automatic size management
 *     - drop and clean a database
 *     - detect and report errors
 *     - optimize (bulk) loading speed
 *     - (temporarily) reduce robustness to gain even more speed
 *     - gather statistics about the database
 *     - estimate size of range query result
 *     - double perfomance by LIFO reclaiming on storages with write-back
 *     - use sequences and canary markers
 *     - use lack-of-space callback (aka OOM-KICK)
 *     - use exclusive mode
 *     - define custom sort orders (but this is recommended to be avoided)
 *
 *
 **** RESTRICTIONS & CAVEATS ***************************************************
 *    in addition to those listed for some functions.
 *
 *  - Troubleshooting the LCK-file.
 *      1. A broken LCK-file can cause sync issues, including appearance of
 *         wrong/inconsistent data for readers. When database opened in the
 *         cooperative read-write mode the LCK-file requires to be mapped to
 *         memory in read-write access. In this case it is always possible for
 *         stray/malfunctioned application could writes thru pointers to
 *         silently corrupt the LCK-file.
 *
 *         Unfortunately, there is no any portable way to prevent such
 *         corruption, since the LCK-file is updated concurrently by
 *         multiple processes in a lock-free manner and any locking is
 *         unwise due to a large overhead.
 *
 *         The "next" version of libmdbx (MithrilDB) will solve this issue.
 *
 *         Workaround: Just make all programs using the database close it;
 *                     the LCK-file is always reset on first open.
 *
 *      2. Stale reader transactions left behind by an aborted program cause
 *         further writes to grow the database quickly, and stale locks can
 *         block further operation.
 *         MDBX checks for stale readers while opening environment and before
 *         growth the database. But in some cases, this may not be enough.
 *
 *         Workaround: Check for stale readers periodically, using the
 *                     mdbx_reader_check() function or the mdbx_stat tool.
 *
 *      3. Stale writers will be cleared automatically by MDBX on supprted
 *         platforms. But this is platform-specific, especially of
 *         implementation of shared POSIX-mutexes and support for robust
 *         mutexes. For instance there are no known issues on Linux, OSX,
 *         Windows and FreeBSD.
 *
 *         Workaround: Otherwise just make all programs using the database
 *                     close it; the LCK-file is always reset on first open
 *                     of the environment.
 *
 *  - Do not use MDBX databases on remote filesystems, even between processes
 *    on the same host. This breaks file locks on some platforms, possibly
 *    memory map sync, and certainly sync between programs on different hosts.
 *
 *    On the other hand, MDBX support the exclusive database operation over
 *    a network, and cooperative read-only access to the database placed on
 *    a read-only network shares.
 *
 *  - Do not use opened MDBX_env instance(s) in a child processes after fork().
 *    It would be insane to call fork() and any MDBX-functions simultaneously
 *    from multiple threads. The best way is to prevent the presence of open
 *    MDBX-instances during fork().
 *
 *    The MDBX_TXN_CHECKPID build-time option, which is ON by default on
 *    non-Windows platforms (i.e. where fork() is available), enables PID
 *    checking at a few critical points. But this does not give any guarantees,
 *    but only allows you to detect such errors a little sooner. Depending on
 *    the platform, you should expect an application crash and/or database
 *    corruption in such cases.
 *
 *    On the other hand, MDBX allow calling mdbx_close_env() in such cases to
 *    release resources, but no more and in general this is a wrong way.
 *
 *  - There is no pure read-only mode in a normal explicitly way, since
 *    readers need write access to LCK-file to be ones visible for writer.
 *    MDBX always tries to open/create LCK-file for read-write, but switches
 *    to without-LCK mode on appropriate errors (EROFS, EACCESS, EPERM)
 *    if the read-only mode was requested by the MDBX_RDONLY flag which is
 *    described below.
 *
 *    The "next" version of libmdbx (MithrilDB) will solve this issue.
 *
 *  - A thread can only use one transaction at a time, plus any nested
 *    read-write transactions in the non-writemap mode. Each transaction
 *    belongs to one thread. The MDBX_NOTLS flag changes this for read-only
 *    transactions. See below.
 *
 *    Do not start more than one transaction for a one thread. If you think
 *    about this, it's really strange to do something with two data snapshots
 *    at once, which may be different. MDBX checks and preventing this by
 *    returning corresponding error code (MDBX_TXN_OVERLAPPING, MDBX_BAD_RSLOT,
 *    MDBX_BUSY) unless you using MDBX_NOTLS option on the environment.
 *    Nonetheless, with the MDBX_NOTLS option, you must know exactly what you
 *    are doing, otherwise you will get deadlocks or reading an alien data.
 *
 *  - Do not have open an MDBX database twice in the same process at the same
 *    time. By default MDBX prevent this in most cases by tracking databases
 *    opening and return MDBX_BUSY if anyone LCK-file is already open.
 *
 *    The reason for this is that when the "Open file description" locks (aka
 *    OFD-locks) are not available, MDBX uses POSIX locks on files, and these
 *    locks have issues if one process opens a file multiple times. If a single
 *    process opens the same environment multiple times, closing it once will
 *    remove all the locks held on it, and the other instances will be
 *    vulnerable to corruption from other processes.
 *
 *    For compatibility with LMDB which allows multi-opening, MDBX can be
 *    configured at runtime by mdbx_setup_debug(MDBX_DBG_LEGACY_MULTIOPEN, ...)
 *    prior to calling other MDBX funcitons. In this way MDBX will track
 *    databases opening, detect multi-opening cases and then recover POSIX file
 *    locks as necessary. However, lock recovery can cause unexpected pauses,
 *    such as when another process opened the database in exclusive mode before
 *    the lock was restored - we have to wait until such a process releases the
 *    database, and so on.
 *
 *  - Avoid long-lived read transactions, especially in the scenarios with a
 *    high rate of write transactions. Long-lived read transactions prevents
 *    recycling pages retired/freed by newer write transactions, thus the
 *    database can grow quickly.
 *
 *    Understanding the problem of long-lived read transactions requires some
 *    explanation, but can be difficult for quick perception. So is is
 *    reasonable to simplify this as follows:
 *      1. Garbage collection problem exists in all databases one way or
 *         another, e.g. VACUUM in PostgreSQL. But in MDBX it's even more
 *         discernible because of high transaction rate and intentional
 *         internals simplification in favor of performance.
 *
 *      2. MDBX employs Multiversion concurrency control on the Copy-on-Write
 *         basis, that allows multiple readers runs in parallel with a write
 *         transaction without blocking. An each write transaction needs free
 *         pages to put the changed data, that pages will be placed in the new
 *         b-tree snapshot at commit. MDBX efficiently recycling pages from
 *         previous created unused snapshots, BUT this is impossible if anyone
 *         a read transaction use such snapshot.
 *
 *      3. Thus massive altering of data during a parallel long read operation
 *         will increase the process's work set and may exhaust entire free
 *         database space.
 *
 *    A good example of long readers is a hot backup to the slow destination
 *    or debugging of a client application while retaining an active read
 *    transaction. LMDB this results in MAP_FULL error and subsequent write
 *    performance degradation.
 *
 *    MDBX mostly solve "long-lived" readers issue by the lack-of-space callback
 *    which allow to aborts long readers, and by the MDBX_LIFORECLAIM mode which
 *    addresses subsequent performance degradation.
 *    The "next" version of libmdbx (MithrilDB) will completely solve this.
 *
 *  - Avoid suspending a process with active transactions. These would then be
 *    "long-lived" as above.
 *
 *    The "next" version of libmdbx (MithrilDB) will solve this issue.
 *
 *  - Avoid aborting a process with an active read-only transaction in scenaries
 *    with high rate of write transactions. The transaction becomes "long-lived"
 *    as above until a check for stale readers is performed or the LCK-file is
 *    reset, since the process may not remove it from the lockfile. This does
 *    not apply to write transactions if the system clears stale writers, see
 *    above.
 *
 *  - An MDBX database configuration will often reserve considerable unused
 *    memory address space and maybe file size for future growth. This does
 *    not use actual memory or disk space, but users may need to understand
 *    the difference so they won't be scared off.
 *
 *  - The Write Amplification Factor.
 *    TBD.

 *   - Thus during commit a I/O buffers should be flushed to the disk twice;
 *     i.e. fdatasync(), FlushFileBuffers() or similar syscall should be called
 *     twice for each commit. This is very expensive for performance, but
 *     guaranteed durability even on unexpected system failure or power outage.
 *     Of course, provided that the operating system and the underlying hardware
 *     (e.g. disk) work correctly.
 *
 * TRADE-OFF: By skipping some stages described above, you can significantly
 * benefit in speed, while partially or completely losing in the guarantee of
 * data durability and/or consistency in the event of system or power failure.
 * Moreover, if for any reason disk write order is not preserved, then at moment
 * of a system crash, a meta-page with a pointer to the new B-tree may be
 * written to disk, while the itself B-tree not yet. In that case, the database
 * will be corrupted!
 *
 *
 * MDBX_NOMETASYNC = don't sync the meta-page after commit.
 *
 *      Flush system buffers to disk only once per transaction, omit the
 *      metadata flush. Defer that until the system flushes files to disk,
 *      or next non-MDBX_RDONLY commit or mdbx_env_sync(). Depending on the
 *      platform and hardware, with MDBX_NOMETASYNC you may get a doubling of
 *      write performance.
 *
 *      This trade-off maintains database integrity, but a system crash may
 *      undo the last committed transaction. I.e. it preserves the ACI
 *      (atomicity, consistency, isolation) but not D (durability) database
 *      property.
 *
 *      MDBX_NOMETASYNC flag may be changed at any time using
 *      mdbx_env_set_flags() or by passing to mdbx_txn_begin() for particular
 *      write transaction.
 *
 *
 * MDBX_UTTERLY_NOSYNC = don't sync anything and wipe previous steady commits.
 *
 *      Don't flush system buffers to disk when committing a transaction. This
 *      optimization means a system crash can corrupt the database, if buffers
 *      are not yet flushed to disk. Depending on the platform and hardware,
 *      with MDBX_UTTERLY_NOSYNC you may get a multiple increase of write
 *      performance, even 100 times or more.
 *
 *      If the filesystem preserves write order (which is rare and never
 *      provided unless explicitly noted) and the MDBX_WRITEMAP and
 *      MDBX_LIFORECLAIM flags are not used, then a system crash can't corrupt
 *      the database, but you can lose the last transactions, if at least one
 *      buffer is not yet flushed to disk. The risk is governed by how often the
 *      system flushes dirty buffers to disk and how often mdbx_env_sync() is
 *      called. So, transactions exhibit ACI (atomicity, consistency, isolation)
 *      properties and only lose D (durability). I.e. database integrity is
 *      maintained, but a system crash may undo the final transactions.
 *
 *      Otherwise, if the filesystem not preserves write order (which is
 *      typically) or MDBX_WRITEMAP or MDBX_LIFORECLAIM flags are used, you
 *      should expect the corrupted database after a system crash.
 *
 *      So, most important thing about MDBX_UTTERLY_NOSYNC:
 *       - a system crash immediately after commit the write transaction
 *         high likely lead to database corruption.
 *       - successful completion of mdbx_env_sync(force = true) after one or
 *         more commited transactions guarantees consystency and durability.
 *       - BUT by committing two or more transactions you back database into a
 *         weak state, in which a system crash may lead to database corruption!
 *         In case single transaction after mdbx_env_sync, you may lose
 *         transaction itself, but not a whole database.
 *
 *      Nevertheless, MDBX_UTTERLY_NOSYNC provides "weak" durability in case of
 *      an application crash (but no durability on system failure), and
 *      therefore may be very useful in scenarios where data durability is not
 *      required over a system failure (e.g for short-lived data), or if you can
 *      take such risk.
 *
 *      MDBX_UTTERLY_NOSYNC flag may be changed at any time using
 *      mdbx_env_set_flags(), but don't has effect if passed to mdbx_txn_begin()
 *      for particular write transaction.
 *
 *
 * MDBX_SAFE_NOSYNC = don't sync anything but keep previous steady commits.
 *
 *      Like MDBX_UTTERLY_NOSYNC the MDBX_SAFE_NOSYNC flag similarly disable
 *      flush system buffers to disk when committing a transaction. But there
 *      is a huge difference in how are recycled the MVCC snapshots
 *      corresponding to previous "steady" transactions (see below).
 *
 *      Depending on the platform and hardware, with MDBX_SAFE_NOSYNC you may
 *      get a multiple increase of write performance, even 10 times or more.
 *      NOTE that (MDBX_SAFE_NOSYNC | MDBX_WRITEMAP) leaves the system with no
 *      hint for when to write transactions to disk. Therefore the
 *      (MDBX_MAPASYNC | MDBX_WRITEMAP) may be preferable, but without
 *      MDBX_SAFE_NOSYNC because the (MDBX_MAPASYNC | MDBX_SAFE_NOSYNC) actually
 *      gives MDBX_UTTERLY_NOSYNC.
 *
 *      In contrast to MDBX_UTTERLY_NOSYNC mode, with MDBX_SAFE_NOSYNC flag MDBX
 *      will keeps untouched pages within B-tree of the last transaction
 *      "steady" which was synced to disk completely. This has big implications
 *      for both data durability and (unfortunately) performance:
 *       - a system crash can't corrupt the database, but you will lose the
 *         last transactions; because MDBX will rollback to last steady commit
 *         since it kept explicitly.
 *       - the last steady transaction makes an effect similar to "long-lived"
 *         read transaction (see above in the "RESTRICTIONS & CAVEATS" section)
 *         since prevents reuse of pages freed by newer write transactions,
 *         thus the any data changes will be placed in newly allocated pages.
 *       - to avoid rapid database growth, the system will sync data and issue
 *         a steady commit-point to resume reuse pages, each time there is
 *         insufficient space and before increasing the size of the file on
 *         disk.
 *
 *      In other words, with MDBX_SAFE_NOSYNC flag MDBX insures you from the
 *      whole database corruption, at the cost increasing database size and/or
 *      number of disk IOPS. So, MDBX_SAFE_NOSYNC flag could be used with
 *      mdbx_env_synv() as alternatively for batch committing or nested
 *      transaction (in some cases). As well, auto-sync feature exposed by
 *      mdbx_env_set_syncbytes() and mdbx_env_set_syncperiod() functions could
 *      be very usefull with MDBX_SAFE_NOSYNC flag.
 *
 *      The number and volume of of disk IOPS with MDBX_SAFE_NOSYNC flag will
 *      exactly the as without any no-sync flags. However, you should expect a
 *      larger process's work set (https://bit.ly/2kA2tFX) and significantly
 *      worse a locality of reference (https://bit.ly/2mbYq2J), due to the more
 *      intensive allocation of previously unused pages and increase the size of
 *      the database.
 *
 *      MDBX_SAFE_NOSYNC flag may be changed at any time using
 *      mdbx_env_set_flags() or by passing to mdbx_txn_begin() for particular
 *      write transaction.
 *
 *
 * MDBX_MAPASYNC = use asynchronous msync when MDBX_WRITEMAP is used.
 *
 *      MDBX_MAPASYNC meaningful and give effect only in conjunction
 *      with MDBX_WRITEMAP or MDBX_SAFE_NOSYNC:
 *       - with MDBX_SAFE_NOSYNC actually gives MDBX_UTTERLY_NOSYNC, which
 *         wipe previous steady commits for reuse pages as described above.
 *       - with MDBX_WRITEMAP but without MDBX_SAFE_NOSYNC instructs MDBX to use
 *         asynchronous mmap-flushes to disk as described below.
 *       - with both MDBX_WRITEMAP and MDBX_SAFE_NOSYNC you get the both
 *         effects.
 *
 *      Asynchronous mmap-flushes means that actually all writes will scheduled
 *      and performed by operation system on it own manner, i.e. unordered.
 *      MDBX itself just notify operating system that it would be nice to write
 *      data to disk, but no more.
 *
 *      With MDBX_MAPASYNC flag, but without MDBX_UTTERLY_NOSYNC (i.e. without
 *      OR'ing with MDBX_SAFE_NOSYNC) MDBX will keeps untouched pages within
 *      B-tree of the last transaction "steady" which was synced to disk
 *      completely. So, this makes exactly the same "long-lived" impact and the
 *      same consequences as described above for MDBX_SAFE_NOSYNC flag.
 *
 *      Depending on the platform and hardware, with combination of
 *      MDBX_WRITEMAP and MDBX_MAPASYNC you may get a multiple increase of write
 *      performance, even 25 times or more. MDBX_MAPASYNC flag may be changed at
 *      any time using mdbx_env_set_flags() or by passing to mdbx_txn_begin()
 *      for particular write transaction.

 *  - In case mdbx_env_info_ex() or legacy mdbx_env_info() was called BEFORE
 *    mdbx_env_open(), i.e. for closed environment, then the specified
 *    parameters will be used for new database creation, or will be appliend
 *    during openeing if database exists and no other process using it.
 *
 *    If the database is already exist, opened with MDBX_EXCLUSIVE or not used
 *    by any other process, and parameters specified by mdbx_env_set_geometry()
 *    are incompatible (i.e. for instance, different page size) then
 *    mdbx_env_open() will return MDBX_INCOMPATIBLE error.
 *
 *    In another way, if database will opened read-only or will used by other
 *    process during calling mdbx_env_open() that specified parameters will
 *    silently discarded (open the database with MDBX_EXCLUSIVE flag to avoid
 *    this).
 *
 *  - In case mdbx_env_info_ex() or legacy mdbx_env_info() was called after
 *    mdbx_env_open() WITHIN the write transaction running by current thread,
 *    then specified parameters will be appliad as a part of write transaction,
 *    i.e. will not be visible to any others processes until the current write
 *    transaction has been committed by the current process. However, if
 *    transaction will be aborted, then the database file will be reverted to
 *    the previous size not immediately, but when a next transaction will be
 *    committed or when the database will be opened next time.
 *
 *  - In case mdbx_env_info_ex() or legacy mdbx_env_info() was called after
 *    mdbx_env_open() but OUTSIDE a write transaction, then MDBX will execute
 *    internal pseudo-transaction to apply new parameters (but only if anything
 *    has been changed), and changes be visible to any others processes
 *    immediatelly after succesfull competeion of function.
 *
 * Essentially a concept of "automatic size management" is simple and useful:
 *  - There are the lower and upper bound of the database file size;
 *  - There is the growth step by which the database file will be increased,
 *    in case of lack of space.
 *  - There is the threshold for unused space, beyond which the database file
 *    will be shrunk.
 *  - The size of the memory map is also the maximum size of the database.
 *  - MDBX will automatically manage both the size of the database and the size
 *    of memory map, according to the given parameters.
 *
 * So, there some considerations about choosing these parameters:
 *  - The lower bound allows you to prevent database shrinking below some
 *    rational size to avoid unnecessary resizing costs.
 *  - The upper bound allows you to prevent database growth above some rational
 *    size. Besides, the upper bound defines the linear address space
 *    reservation in each process that opens the database. Therefore changing
 *    the upper bound is costly and may be required reopening environment in
 *    case of MDBX_UNABLE_EXTEND_MAPSIZE errors, and so on. Therefore, this
 *    value should be chosen reasonable as large as possible, to accommodate
 *    future growth of the database.
 *  - The growth step must be greater than zero to allow the database to grow,
 *    but also reasonable not too small, since increasing the size by little
 *    steps will result a large overhead.
 *  - The shrink threshold must be greater than zero to allow the database
 *    to shrink but also reasonable not too small (to avoid extra overhead) and
 *    not less than growth step to avoid up-and-down flouncing.
 *  - The current size (i.e. size_now argument) is an auxiliary parameter for
 *    simulation legacy mdbx_env_set_mapsize() and as workaround Windows issues
 *    (see below).
 *
 * Unfortunately, Windows has is a several issues
 * with resizing of memory-mapped file:
 *  - Windows unable shrinking a memory-mapped file (i.e memory-mapped section)
 *    in any way except unmapping file entirely and then map again. Moreover,
 *    it is impossible in any way if a memory-mapped file is used more than
 *    one process.
 *  - Windows does not provide the usual API to augment a memory-mapped file
 *    (that is, a memory-mapped partition), but only by using "Native API"
 *    in an undocumented way.
 *
 * MDBX bypasses all Windows issues, but at a cost:
 *  - Ability to resize database on the fly requires an additional lock
 *    and release SlimReadWriteLock during each read-only transaction.
 *  - During resize all in-process threads should be paused and then resumed.
 *  - Shrinking of database file is performed only when it used by single
 *    process, i.e. when a database closes by the last process or opened
 *    by the first.
 *  = Therefore, the size_now argument may be useful to set database size
 *    by the first process which open a database, and thus avoid expensive
 *    remapping further.
 *
 * For create a new database with particular parameters, including the page
 * size, mdbx_env_set_geometry() should be called after mdbx_env_create() and
 * before mdbx_env_open(). Once the database is created, the page size cannot be
 * changed. If you do not specify all or some of the parameters, the
 * corresponding default values will be used. For instance, the default for
 * database size is 10485760 bytes.
 *
 * If the mapsize is increased by another process, MDBX silently and
 * transparently adopt these changes at next transaction start. However,
 * mdbx_txn_begin() will return MDBX_UNABLE_EXTEND_MAPSIZE if new mapping size
 * could not be applied for current process (for instance if address space
 * is busy).  Therefore, in the case of MDBX_UNABLE_EXTEND_MAPSIZE error you
 * need close and reopen the environment to resolve error.
 *
 * NOTE: Actual values may be different than your have specified because of
 * rounding to specified database page size, the system page size and/or the
 * size of the system virtual memory management unit. You can get actual values
 * by mdbx_env_sync_ex() or see by using the tool "mdbx_chk" with the "-v"
 * option.
 *
 * Legacy mdbx_env_set_mapsize() correspond to calling mdbx_env_set_geometry()
 * with the arguments size_lower, size_now, size_upper equal to the size
 * and -1 (i.e. default) for all other parameters.
 *
 * [in] env               An environment handle returned by mdbx_env_create()
 *
 * [in] size_lower        The lower bound of database sive in bytes.
 *                        Zero value means "minimal acceptable",
 *                        and negative means "keep current or use default".
 *
 * [in] size_now          The size in bytes to setup the database size for now.
 *                        Zero value means "minimal acceptable",
 *                        and negative means "keep current or use default".
 *                        So, it is recommended always pass -1 in this argument
 *                        except some special cases.
 *
 * [in] size_upper        The upper bound of database sive in bytes.
 *                        Zero value means "minimal acceptable",
 *                        and negative means "keep current or use default".
 *                        It is recommended to avoid change upper bound while
 *                        database is used by other processes or threaded
 *                        (i.e. just pass -1 in this argument except absolutely
 *                        necessity). Otherwise you must be ready for
 *                        MDBX_UNABLE_EXTEND_MAPSIZE error(s), unexpected pauses
 *                        during remapping and/or system errors like "addtress
 *                        busy", and so on. In other words, there is no way to
 *                        handle a growth of the upper bound robustly because
 *                        there may be a lack of appropriate system resources
 *                        (which are extremely volatile in a multi-process
 *                        multi-threaded environment).
 *
 * [in] growth_step       The growth step in bytes, must be greater than zero
 *                        to allow the database to grow.
 *                        Negative value means "keep current or use default".
 *
 * [in] shrink_threshold  The shrink threshold in bytes, must be greater than
 *                        zero to allow the database to shrink.
 *                        Negative value means "keep current or use default".
 *
 * [in] pagesize          The database page size for new database creation
 *                        or -1 otherwise. Must be power of 2 in the range
 *                        between MDBX_MIN_PAGESIZE and MDBX_MAX_PAGESIZE.
 *                        Zero value means "minimal acceptable",
 *                        and negative means "keep current or use default".
 *
 * Returns A non-zero error value on failure and 0 on success,
 * some possible errors are:
 *  - MDBX_EINVAL    = An invalid parameter was specified,
 *                     or the environment has an active write transaction.
 *  - MDBX_EPERM     = specific for Windows: Shrinking was disabled before and
 *                     now it wanna be enabled, but there are reading threads
 *                     that don't use the additional SRWL (that is required to
 *                     avoid Windows issues).
 *  - MDBX_EACCESS   = The environment opened in read-only.
 *  - MDBX_MAP_FULL  = Specified size smaller than the space already
 *                     consumed by the environment.
 *  - MDBX_TOO_LARGE = Specified size is too large, i.e. too many pages for
 *                     given size, or a 32-bit process requests too much bytes
 *                     for the 32-bit address space. */

/* Open a database in the environment.
 *
 * A database handle denotes the name and parameters of a database,
 * independently of whether such a database exists. The database handle may be
 * discarded by calling mdbx_dbi_close(). The old database handle is returned if
 * the database was already open. The handle may only be closed once.
 *
 * (!) A notable difference between MDBX and LMDB is that MDBX make handles
 * opened for existing databases immediately available for other transactions,
 * regardless this transaction will be aborted or reset. The REASON for this is
 * to avoiding the requirement for multiple opening a same handles in concurrent
 * read transactions, and tracking of such open but hidden handles until the
 * completion of read transactions which opened them.
 *
 * Nevertheless, the handle for the NEWLY CREATED database will be invisible for
 * other transactions until the this write transaction is successfully
 * committed. If the write transaction is aborted the handle will be closed
 * automatically. After a successful commit the such handle will reside in the
 * shared environment, and may be used by other transactions.
 *
 * In contrast to LMDB, the MDBX allow this function to be called from multiple
 * concurrent transactions or threads in the same process.
 *
 * To use named database (with name != NULL), mdbx_env_set_maxdbs()
 * must be called before opening the environment. Table names are
 * keys in the internal unnamed database, and may be read but not written.
 *
 * [in] txn    transaction handle returned by mdbx_txn_begin().
 * [in] name   The name of the database to open. If only a single
 *             database is needed in the environment, this value may be NULL.
 * [in] flags  Special options for this database. This parameter must be set
 *             to 0 or by bitwise OR'ing together one or more of the values
 *             described here:
 *  - MDBX_REVERSEKEY
 *      Keys are strings to be compared in reverse order, from the end
 *      of the strings to the beginning. By default, Keys are treated as
 *      strings and compared from beginning to end.
 *  - MDBX_DUPSORT
 *      Duplicate keys may be used in the database. Or, from another point of
 *      view, keys may have multiple data items, stored in sorted order. By
 *      default keys must be unique and may have only a single data item.
 *  - MDBX_INTEGERKEY
 *      Keys are binary integers in native byte order, either uin32_t or
 *      uint64_t, and will be sorted as such. The keys must all be of the
 *      same size and must be aligned while passing as arguments.
 *  - MDBX_DUPFIXED
 *      This flag may only be used in combination with MDBX_DUPSORT. This
 *      option tells the library that the data items for this database are
 *      all the same size, which allows further optimizations in storage and
 *      retrieval. When all data items are the same size, the MDBX_GET_MULTIPLE,
 *      MDBX_NEXT_MULTIPLE and MDBX_PREV_MULTIPLE cursor operations may be used
 *      to retrieve multiple items at once.
 *  - MDBX_INTEGERDUP
 *      This option specifies that duplicate data items are binary integers,
 *      similar to MDBX_INTEGERKEY keys. The data values must all be of the
 *      same size and must be aligned while passing as arguments.
 *  - MDBX_REVERSEDUP
 *      This option specifies that duplicate data items should be compared as
 *      strings in reverse order (the comparison is performed in the direction
 *      from the last byte to the first).
 *  - MDBX_CREATE
 *      Create the named database if it doesn't exist. This option is not
 *      allowed in a read-only transaction or a read-only environment.
 *
 * [out] dbi     Address where the new MDBX_dbi handle will be stored.
 *
 * For mdbx_dbi_open_ex() additional arguments allow you to set custom
 * comparison functions for keys and values (for multimaps).
 * However, I recommend not using custom comparison functions, but instead
 * converting the keys to one of the forms that are suitable for built-in
 * comparators (for instance take look to the mdbx_key_from_xxx()
 * functions). The reasons to not using custom comparators are:
 *   - The order of records could not be validated without your code.
 *     So mdbx_chk utility will reports "wrong order" errors
 *     and the '-i' option is required to ignore ones.
 *   - A records could not be ordered or sorted without your code.
 *     So mdbx_load utility should be used with '-a' option to preserve
 *     input data order.
 *
 * [in] keycmp   Optional custom key comparison function for a database.
 * [in] datacmp  Optional custom data comparison function for a database, takes

 *  - MDBX_DBS_FULL      = too many databases have been opened.
 *                         See mdbx_env_set_maxdbs().
 *  - MDBX_INCOMPATIBLE  = Database is incompatible with given flags,
 *                         i.e. the passed flags is different with which the

 *      was opened with MDBX_DUPSORT. The function will return MDBX_KEYEXIST
 *      if the key/data pair already appears in the database.
 *
 *  - MDBX_NOOVERWRITE
 *      Enter the new key/data pair only if the key does not already appear
 *      in the database. The function will return MDBX_KEYEXIST if the key
 *      already appears in the database, even if the database supports
 *      duplicates (MDBX_DUPSORT). The data parameter will be set to point
 *      to the existing item.
 *
 *  - MDBX_CURRENT
 *      Update an single existing entry, but not add new ones. The function
 *      will return MDBX_NOTFOUND if the given key not exist in the database.
 *      Or the MDBX_EMULTIVAL in case duplicates for the given key.
 *
 *  - MDBX_RESERVE
 *      Reserve space for data of the given size, but don't copy the given
 *      data. Instead, return a pointer to the reserved space, which the
 *      caller can fill in later - before the next update operation or the
 *      transaction ends. This saves an extra memcpy if the data is being
 *      generated later. MDBX does nothing else with this memory, the caller
 *      is expected to modify all of the space requested. This flag must not
 *      be specified if the database was opened with MDBX_DUPSORT.
 *
 *  - MDBX_APPEND
 *      Append the given key/data pair to the end of the database. This option
 *      allows fast bulk loading when keys are already known to be in the
 *      correct order. Loading unsorted keys with this flag will cause
 *      a MDBX_EKEYMISMATCH error.
